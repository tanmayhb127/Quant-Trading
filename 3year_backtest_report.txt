4. DIRECTIONAL BIAS
   - Definition: (Avg High Error - Avg Low Error)

DETAILED ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Range Coverage Pattern:
  - All sources show ~96-97% "Low Miss" rate
  - This indicates predictions are consistently TOO HIGH on the low bound
  - Nifty typically trades LOWER than predicted support levels
  - Insight: If using these ranges for risk management, use TIGHTER stops than predicted

Accuracy Comparison:
  Best Source (Hit Rate):      mint_nifty50_3year.csv: 4.56%
  Average Hit Rate:             3.40%
  Worst Source (Hit Rate):      timesnowbusiness_nifty50_3year.csv: 2.90%
  
  Best Source (Abs Error):      economictimeslive_nifty50_3year.csv: 3970.61 pts
  Worst Source (Abs Error):     etnow_nifty50_3year.csv: 3979.16 pts

Bias Analysis:
  Most Pessimistic (Lowest Bias):  etnow_nifty50_3year.csv: -3971.80 pts
  Most Optimistic (Highest Bias):  economictimeslive_nifty50_3year.csv: -3963.39 pts
  
  Interpretation: All sources show negative bias (biased LOW)

KEY INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. SYNTHETIC DATA CAVEAT
   - This backtest uses SYNTHETIC price predictions (not real news channel data)
   - Real predictions may have different accuracy characteristics
   - Consider collecting REAL predictions for more accurate backtesting

2. PREDICTION QUALITY
   - Hit rates ~3-5% suggest:
     a) Predictions are very wide ranges (not precise)
     b) Actual volatility often exceeds predicted ranges
     c) OR both (realistic given market dynamics)

3. RISK MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS
   - Predicted ranges are TOO HIGH on the low side (96%+ Low Miss rate)
   - Traders using these: Set stops TIGHTER than predicted support
   - Expected slippage: ~1,590 pts below predicted support on average

4. FOR TRADING STRATEGY
   - Combine predictions with:
     a) Support/Resistance from technical analysis
     b) Options implied volatility (IV) for expected range
     c) Historical volatility patterns
   - Don't rely solely on news-channel predictions

5. MODEL IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES
   - Train a machine learning model to ADJUST predictions
   - Use features: source, market open, implied vol, day-of-week, etc.
   - Target: Minimize error or maximize hit rate
   - Backtesting framework ready (see train_gbm.py)

NEXT STEPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Review visualizations for patterns (PNG files)
2. Consider collecting REAL news channel predictions for production use
3. Experiment with LightGBM model (train_gbm.py) to improve predictions
4. Use LLM for natural language classification (run_llm_prompts.py)
5. Deploy best model to production with retraining schedule
